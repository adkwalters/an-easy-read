                            <p class="summary level-1">Over the past decade, Hila and Ethan Klein have become Internet celebrities for their popular YouTube channel. They started off making videos of themselves doing funny things or reacting to other people’s videos.

As a result, they have gained millions of fans, some of whom feel very close to the couple, almost as though they know Hila and Ethan personally.</p>

                            <p class="summary level-2">Hila and Ethan talk a lot about things that happen to them. They have a baby and want to have another baby. However, it isn’t easy for them. They need a doctor to help them. In Hila and Ethan’s videos, they talk about wanting another baby. They talk about going to the doctor and what the doctors say. When they got the news that they were going to have a baby, all their fans got the news at the same time as they did. This is a bit strange because people normally only tell their best friends and family in this situation.</p>
                            <p class="summary level-1">Hila and Ethan share many parts of their personal lives with their online audience.

                            <p class="summary level-2">People like Hila and Ethan are called ‘Internet influencers’. They are so popular on the Internet that they can change the way that people think and feel. For Internet influencers, sharing personal information is normal. They tell their fans many kinds of personal stories about their lives. These stories are sometimes so personal that some fans have not heard stories like these before. Fans might repeat these stories to real-life friends and say that a friend told them.</p>
                            <p class="summary level-1">Sharing personal information about their lives is normal for Internet influencers like Hila and Ethan. Internet influencers often speak directly into the camera, as though they are looking directly into their audience’s eyes. They discuss changes in their relationships. They talk about birth, illness and death, sometimes for hours. These are conversations that the audience themselves often have not had with their real-life friends. Fans may retell stories as though they actually know the Internet influencer themselves.</p>

                            <p class="summary level-2">In 1956, two scientists said that this kind of friendship was not normal for society. They thought that people who work on TV could not be friends with all the people who watch them on TV because they can’t talk together. Also, the person on TV can do anything but the person watching can only watch.</p>
                            <p class="summary level-1">In 1956, two scientists called this kind of relationship ‘para-social’, meaning that it was not normal for society. They believed that a relationship between people who performed and people who watched them perform could not be more than one-sided. This was because the performer was in control and the person watching could not join in with the discussion.</p>
