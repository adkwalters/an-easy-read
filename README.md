# An Easy Read

A web app designed to help EFL learners to improve their reading skill. 

## Concept
The concept of An Easy Read is built off the idea of progressive summarisation; users can progressively increase or decrease the reading level of each paragraph in an article to match their reading ability. 

Other sites offer a similar concept. Wikipedia, for example, can be translated to [simple English](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). However, these sites tend to be inflexible, offering only a single reading level per webpage. Should a student wish to change the reading level of an article, they must navigate to a new page, leading to the loss of their position and momentum. Contrastingly, An Easy Read provides a mechanic for students to increase or decrease the reading level of each paragraph *in situ*.

Furthermore, An Easy Read offers a custom-built CMS so that users can create their own content. By creating an account, anyone can write, save and edit their own articles, and request that these articles be published. Empowered users - publishers - can additionally review, edit and publish the articles that have been requested for publication. In the aim of continuity and community, publishers can recruit writers, ensuring that their writer's requests will be sent to them alone.

## Content
An Easy Read aims to summarise interesting articles that are difficult for English learners to parse, whether it be due to advanced subject matter, complex vocabulary and sentence structure, or the use of culture-specific expressions and idioms. Once users are able to understand An Easy Read article at its most difficult level, they should be prepared to tackle the original source content. 

Each article produced with An Easy Read targets two main reading levels in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). These are basic (A1-A2) and independent (B1-B2). The reading level of each piece of text is measured using text analysers from [cefrlevels](https://www.cefrlevels.com/textanalysis/index.html) and [Oxford Learner's Dictionaries](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/text-checker/), as well as this creator's 6 years experience teaching English as a foreign language.

n.b. The number of versions of each paragraph is not restricted. Any number of levels can be uploaded.
